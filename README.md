# IBM-Hr-Analytics-Employee
The project titled "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" revolves around analyzing and addressing employee attrition within an organization. Using a dataset created by IBM's data scientists, the project explores factors influencing attrition, such as demographics, job satisfaction, compensation, and work-life balance. The objective is to gain insights into current turnover rates and identify key drivers, such as monthly income, distance from home, job role, and educational background. Employing Python, machine learning, SQL, and Excel, the analysis aims to uncover patterns, establish correlations, and propose actionable strategies for improving employee retention, thereby enhancing organizational stability and reducing costs associated with high attrition rates.
